# Universal Git Plugin for Insomnia API Client

This plugin for Insomnia aims to ease syncing your workspaces, directories or even single requests to your Git repositories. 

## Current Features
### GitLab
*   Sync Workspace
### GitHub
*   Sync Workspace

## How to use this plugin

Just install it via the [Insomnia Plugin Hub](https://insomnia.rest/plugins).

As I'm currently releasing updates nearly every day and the plugin hub only updates very rarely I'd recommend to install the plugin directly from npm by its name `insomnia-plugin-universal-git` under `Insomnia -> Preferences -> Plugins`.

After installing just hit the dropdown menu located right beneath the workspace/collections name, go through the setup and start pulling/pushing your config.
